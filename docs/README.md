Provided is the output of calling `pydoc` on the package. To explore the public method documentation (mostly helpful for pythonian) simply open any of the files in a browser (they are all linked together). Provided above is a link to htmlpreview.github.io which will show the documents in this folder as the html pages they are. Alternatively, if you want a live browser to look over the objects and functions offered by this package call `python3 -m pydoc -b companionsKQML`. Again, this doesn't show documentation for private functions (despite the fact that all functions are documented in this package) but the useful portions of the API should be shown.
